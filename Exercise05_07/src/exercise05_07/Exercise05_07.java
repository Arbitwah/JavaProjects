    //Instructions:(Financial application: compute future tuition)
    //Suppose that the tuition for a university is $10,000
    //this year and increases 5% every year. In one year, the tuition
    //will be $10,500. Write a program that displays the tuition in
    //ten years and the total cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition after
    //the tenth year.

    while(year <= 9 ){
        tuition +=tuition * taxRate;
        year++;
        //used a while loop to get the tuition after ten years. 
    }

        year++;
        //used a for loop to get the total tuition for four years.
    }
